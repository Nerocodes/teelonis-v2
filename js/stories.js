    title: 'My Woman',
    body: `When Le Boo is proud to have Le Bae as his very own woman.
          She loves to run and had just recently completed the 42km Lagos 
          marathon. With her Fitbit broken - a replacement was such a great idea.
          With a major exam the week after her birthday, he wanted to also let
          her know that he believed in her and was confident she would ace her exams ‚Äì 
          so a personalised cushion pillow with encouraging words was another lovely idea.
          He chose a card which beautifully expressed his thoughts on how proud he was of her 
          as his woman and the cake design was a perfect way to tie it all up together.
          She was surprised to receive her surprise package whilst in work ‚Äì and she absolutely loved it.
          PS: Client told us three weeks later than she aced her exams. Indeed, it was as though 
          the theme and message of her birthday package predicted the future.`,

    body: `With Mummy in Nigeria and most of the children abroad except one ‚Äì our clients wanted to make the Big Day really special for her.
    There was a plan to have a party later on in the year when everyone would get together but the day wasn‚Äôt going to pass by just like that.
    Mummy thought it would be a quiet day though.  Stay indoors and maybe have a few close friends come by the house- but the children had a surprise all planned out.
    Mummy woke up early and went about her normal routine which includes a prayer walk.
    She gets back, has her shower and the birthday wishes phone calls begin to come in. 
    Then at 10am, she gets told she has a make-up artist waiting for her. 
    ‚ÄúWhat Make-up Artist? I didn‚Äôt ask for one!‚Äù she says.
    She gets the response ‚Äì ‚ÄúIt was organised by your children Mummy‚Äù. 
    Whilst Mummy is having her ‚Äúface beat‚Äù, the photographer walks in and she is asked to change into outfits and the mini photo shoot kicks off. 
    While that is going on- the other surprise arrives.
    The Gifts, Cake, Balloons, Fruit Baskets.
    Her gifts were perfect for her undying love for Fabric, Perfumes and Tea. 
    The children truly did blow her away as she felt loved, appreciated and celebrated!
    A day she would definitely not forget in a hurry.`,
