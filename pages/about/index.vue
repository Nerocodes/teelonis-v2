            <li>How to get your gift beautifully packaged</li>
            <li>Finding the time to think of the gifts and/or shop for it.</li>

          <p class="body">Teelonis was founded in April 2009 and it has been an epic ride ever since.</p>
          <p class="body">It began as a company offering personal shopping services for the busy professional in 
          Nigeria who wanted to purchase quality clothing from the UK
          without all the associated stress of shopping.</p>
          <p class="body">The goal was to help our clients live less stressful, happier and more beautiful lives.
          We have since evolved.</p>
          <p class="body">With this passion to help people live more beautiful lives, the founder- Temitope Olonilua
          not only took the bold step to pioneer the industry but has over the past decade built a brand
          that has transitioned from being a personal shopping company to a bespoke gifting company. 
          The goal has remained the same- but with more focus on helping to build, strengthen
           and restore relationships through the art of thoughtful expressions.</p>

          <p class="body">With a superb eye for quality, attention to details, a great dose of creativity 
          and totally driven by passion- we would work with you to give the gift that is truly thoughtful.
          We should also let you know that thoughtfulness isn’t just a way we do business.
          It is who we are.</p>

          <p class="body">With each thoughtful gift delivered, there are at least two happy people.</p>
          <p class="body">You - the Giver and The Recipient.</p>
          <p class="body">With thousands of thoughtful gifts delivered, there are thousands more happy people.</p>
          <p class="body">This is what we live for.</p>
          <p class="body">To create beautiful stories of special moments.</p>
          <p class="body">To sprinkle happiness and joy in the world like confetti.</p>
