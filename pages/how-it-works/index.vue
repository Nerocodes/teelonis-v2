        <p>
          At Teelonis, our approach to giving the perfect gift is BESPOKE. INDIVIDUALISED.  PERSONALISED.
          This means that the gift package is created for you- to suit the recipient, the occasion and your budget.
          With Thoughtful Gifting- one size does not fit all. 
          We believe that you are unlike anyone else, so are your recipients and your relationship with them.
          Your relationship isnâ€™t off the shelf. It is Unique. It is Special. It is unlike any other.
          And so should your gift.
        </p>
        <p>
          Here is how we journey with you to give a truly thoughtful gift:

              1). You answer some questions
            </summary>
            <p>
              The best of gifts are given when the focus is on the recipient.
              We certainly donâ€™t know the recipient as much as you do, 
              so we start the journey by asking you to tell us all you can 
              about the recipient by completing this *short form*.
              We know that sometimes, you donâ€™t have all the information. 
              Whatever you know would be helpful.

              2). You pick your package
            </summary>
            <p>
              Based on the information you have provided; we would send
                some package options for you to choose from.

              3). We deliver
            </summary>
            <p>
              After the gift package has been agreed and payment is received,
              your gift package will be delivered - to you directly or to the recipient.

            <p>
              Okay- this is not a step. ðŸ˜Š 
              It is what you experience after steps 1,2,3.
              The pride from getting it right and giving someone a gift that is perfect for them.
              The joy and excitement you get from making someone else happy.
              Both Priceless emotions.
